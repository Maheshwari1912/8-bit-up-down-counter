# 8-bit-up-down-counter
**AIM:**  
The aim of designing an 8-bit up/down counter is to create a sequential circuit capable of counting upwards or downwards based on a control signal. 

The counter operates with a clock signal and can be reset to its initial state. 

The design should count from 0 to 255 when counting up, and from 255 to 0 when counting down.

**OPERATION:**

An 8-bit up/down counter is a digital sequential circuit that changes its count value on each clock pulse, either incrementing or decrementing based on the control input.
